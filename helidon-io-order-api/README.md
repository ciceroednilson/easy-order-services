## Building a Native Image

The generation of native binaries requires an installation of GraalVM 22.1.0+.

You can build a native binary using Maven as follows:

```
mvn -Pnative-image install -DskipTests
```

The generation of the executable binary may take a few minutes to complete depending on
your hardware and operating system. When completed, the executable file will be available
under the `target` directory and be named after the artifact ID you have chosen during the
project generation phase.
