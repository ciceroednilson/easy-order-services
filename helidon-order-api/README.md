# helidon-order-api

Helidon SE application that uses the dbclient API with MySQL database.

## Build and run


This example requires a database, see [Database Setup](#database-setup).


With JDK21
```bash
mvn package
java -jar target/helidon-order-api.jar
```

## Exercise the application

Basic:
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/simple-greet
Hello World!
```


JSON:
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet
{"message":"Hello World!"}

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Joe
{"message":"Hello Joe!"}

curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"greeting" : "Hola"}' http://localhost:8080/greet/greeting

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/greet/Jose
{"message":"Hola Jose!"}
```


Database:
```
# List all Pokémon
curl http://localhost:8080/db/pokemon

# List all Pokémon types
curl http://localhost:8080/db/type

# Get a single Pokémon by id
curl http://localhost:8080/db/pokemon/2

# Get a single Pokémon by name
curl http://localhost:8080/db/pokemon/name/Squirtle

# Add a new Pokémon Rattata
curl -i -X POST -d '{"id":7,"name":"Rattata","idType":1}' http://localhost:8080/db/pokemon

# Rename Pokémon with id 7 to Raticate
curl -i -X PUT -d '{"id":7,"name":"Raticate","idType":2}' http://localhost:8080/db/pokemon

# Delete Pokémon with id 7
curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/db/pokemon/7
```



## Exercise Webclient

First, start the server:

```
java -jar target/helidon-order-api.jar
```

Note the port number that it displays. For example:

```
WEB server is up! http://localhost:8080/simple-greet
```

Then run the client, passing the port number. It will connect
to the server:

```
java -cp "target/classes:target/libs/*" br.com.ciceroednilson.WebClientMain PORT
```



## Building a Native Image

The generation of native binaries requires an installation of GraalVM 22.1.0+.

You can build a native binary using Maven as follows:

```
mvn -Pnative-image install -DskipTests
```

The generation of the executable binary may take a few minutes to complete depending on
your hardware and operating system. When completed, the executable file will be available
under the `target` directory and be named after the artifact ID you have chosen during the
project generation phase.



### Database Setup

In the `pom.xml` and `application.yaml` we provide configuration needed for mysql database.
Start your database before running this example.

Example docker commands to start databases in temporary containers:

MySQL:
```
docker run --rm --name mysql -p 3306:3306 \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=pokemon \
    -e MYSQL_USER=user \
    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=changeit \
    mysql:5.7
```



## Building the Docker Image

```
docker build -t helidon-order-api .
```

## Running the Docker Image

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 helidon-order-api:latest
```

Exercise the application as described above.
